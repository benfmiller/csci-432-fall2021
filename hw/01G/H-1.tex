\maketitle

This homework assignment should be
submitted as a single PDF file {\bf both to D2L and to Gradescope.}

General homework expectations:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Homework should be typeset using LaTex.
      \item Answers should be in complete sentences and proofread.
      \item You will not plagiarize, nor will you share your written solutions
            with classmates.
      \item List collaborators at the start of each question using the
            \texttt{collab} command.
      \item Put your answers where the \texttt{todo} command currently is (and
            remove the \texttt{todo}, but not the word \texttt{Answer}).
      \item If you are asked to come up with an algorithm, you are
            expected to give an algorithm that beats the brute force (and, if possible, of
            optimal time complexity). With your algorithm, please provide the following:
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item \emph{What}: A prose explanation of the problem and the algorithm,
                        including a description of the input/output.
                  \item \emph{How}: Describe how the algorithm works, including giving
                        psuedocode for it.  Be sure to reference the pseudocode
                        from within the prose explanation.
                  \item \emph{How Fast}: Runtime, along with justification.  (Or, in the
                        extreme, a proof of termination).
                  \item \emph{Why}: Statement of the loop invariant for each loop, or
                        recursion invariant for each recursive function.
            \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\nextprob{More Basics}

\begin{enumerate}

      \item Use the definition of big-Theta notation to prove that $f(x)=4n-5$
            is $\Theta(n+1)$.

            \paragraph{Definition}
            f is $\Theta(g)\ \iff\ f\ is\ O(g)\ and\ f\ is\ \Omega(g)$

            i.e., $ a, b \in R \geq 0, n_{0} \in R$
            $|\ \forall n \geq n_0$

            $0 \leq a* g(n) \leq f(n) \leq b*g(n)$

            \paragraph{Answer}
            \begin{proof}
                  let $a = 1, b = 4, and\ n_0 = 2$

                  $\forall n \geq n_0, 1*n \leq 4*n - 5$

                  $\forall n \geq n_0, 4*n - 5 \leq 4*n$

                  $\therefore f(n)\ is\ \Theta(n)$

                  $\Theta(n+1)$ is equivalent to $\Theta(n)$

                  $\therefore f(n)\ is\ \Theta(n+1)$
            \end{proof}

      \item Use induction to prove that, for all $n \in \N$, the complete graph on
            $n$ vertices (denoted by the symbol~$K_n$) has $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$~edges.

            \paragraph{Definition}
            A complete graph is a graph in which each pair of graph vertices is connected by an edge.
            \footnote{Definition from \href{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CompleteGraph.html}{mathworld.wolfram}}

            \paragraph{Answer}

            {\bf Basis:} f(1) = $\frac{1(1-1)}{2}$


            \todo{}

      \item What is the negation of the following statement: for all integers $n
                  \in \Z$, $n$ is prime.

            \paragraph{Answer}
            $\exists\ an\ integer\ n \in \Z\ |\ n$ is not prime.

\nextprob{Sorting before Searching?}
Let $A$ be an array of $n$ comparable objects.  We do not know if $A$ is sorted
or not.

\begin{enumerate}
      \item To answer the question \emph{is item $x$ in the $A$?}, should we
            sort the array first?  Why or why not?

            \paragraph{Answer}
            \todo{}

      \item Suppose we have $k$ elements that we want to find in $A$. Does this
            change your answer? Why or why~not?

\nextprob{Recurrence Relations}
Consider the function $T \colon \N \to \N$ defined by
$$T(n) = \begin{cases}
            1        & n=1  \\
            T(n-1)+1 & n>1.
      \end{cases}
$$
What is the closed form and asymptotic form of this recursion?  For the
closed form, use induction to prove that it is correct.  For the asymptotic
form, use the definition of big-Theta to justify.

relations? (Show work for partial credit, but full justification is not required
on this question).

\begin{enumerate}
