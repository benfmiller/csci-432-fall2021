\nextprob{Chapter 2, Problem 4, (a)}

For each of the recursive definitions, give the recurrence
relation and state the recursion invariant.  For Part (a), prove that your
recursion invariant holds.  For Part (b), prove that your recursion terminates
using a decrementing function.


{\bf  (a)} Let $A[1.. m]$ and $B[1.. n]$ be two arbitrary arrays. A common subsequence
of A and B is both a subsequence of A and a subsequence of B. Give
a simple recursive definition for the function $lcs(A, B)$, which gives the
length of the longest common subsequence of A and B.

\paragraph{Answer}
\footnote{The original Longest Subsequence algorithm was inspired by the textbook for all of these problems}

If the cuurent element of A and B is equal, we up the count by one, and move on.
If they are not, we advance down B until we find an equal value and recurse. We
take the max of that value and skipping the current value in A.

\begin{algorithm} \caption{\textsc{lcs} ($A[1..n], B[1..n]$)}\label{alg:seb}

    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

{\bf Recurrence Relation: } $T(n) = 2T(n-1) + \Theta(1)$

Realistically, we would do a lot of advancing through both arrays, but oh well. This is worst case.

{\bf Recursion Invariant:} At the end of each iteration, the length of the longest common subsequence has already been computed for A[1..i] and B[1..j].

\begin{proof}
    Assuming that the recursion invariant is true for the previous call, we will show that it holds for the current call.

    If one of the arrays is empty, there are no more common elements, so we contribute zero to the sum and return.
    If the current element of each array is the same, the longest common subsequence will include that character.
    Else, we skip in B until it matches the current element in A. We compare that to the result of skipping the current
    element in A. This is equivalent to taking the max of skipping or taking A. The max of skipping or taking the
    current element of A gives the longest common subsequence for A[1..i+1] and B[1..j] if A[i] and B[j] are not equal.

\end{proof}

\nextprob{Chapter 2, Problem 4, (b)}

For each of the recursive definitions, give the recurrence
relation and state the recursion invariant.

For Part (b), prove that your recursion terminates
using a decrementing function.

{\bf (b)} Let $A[1.. m]$ and $B[1.. n]$ be two arbitrary arrays. A common super-
sequence of A and B is another sequence that contains both A and B
as subsequences. Give a simple recursive definition for the function
$scs(A, B)$, which gives the length of the shortest common supersequence
of A and B.

\paragraph{Answer}

If i or j is greater than the length of the corresponding array, we return the
length of the rest of the other array. If the current position of both arrays is
equal, we take it. Else, we take the minimum of skipping either array.

        \ElsIf{$j > len(B)$}

        \State$return\ mim\{takeA, takeB\}$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

{\bf Recurrence Relation: } $T(n) = 2T(n-1) + \Theta(1)$

{\bf Recursion Invariant:} At the end of each iteration, the length of the shortest common supersequence has already been computed for A[1..i] and B[1..j].

\begin{proof}
    That it terminates with a decrementing function.

    For each iteration of the recursive function, in the worst case, either i or j increase by one. Because A and B are finite,
    i or j will eventually reach the end of their respective array.

    $D(i,j) = D(i+1,j) or D(i,j+1)$
\end{proof}

For each of the recursive definitions, give the recurrence
relation and state the recursion invariant.

{\bf (c)} Call a sequence $X[1.. n]$ of numbers bitonic if there is an index i with
$1 < i < n$, such that the prefix $X[1.. i]$ is increasing and the suffix
$X[i .. n]$ is decreasing. Give a simple recursive definition for the function
$lbs(A)$, which gives the length of the longest bitonic subsequence of an
arbitrary array A of integers.

\paragraph{Answer}

For this one, we recurse up to three times per recursive call. If we are increasing, we try
skiping the current value, taking it, and taking it and flipping the increasing boolean.
If we are decreasing, we do up to two calls. Skip and take.

{\bf (d)} Call a sequence $X[1.. n]$ oscillating if $X[i] < X[i + 1]$ for all even i, and
$X[i] > X[i + 1]$ for all odd i. Give a simple recursive definition for
the function $los(A)$, which gives the length of the longest oscillating
subsequence of an arbitrary array A of integers.

\paragraph{Answer}

We will calculate this like we did the first way for longest increasing subsequence, but we'll add a
flag to tell if it's increasing or decreasing (even or odd)
The initial call to the recursive algorithm gives even as false to account for the sentinel value

For each of the recursive definitions, give the recurrence
relation and state the recursion invariant.

{\bf (e)} Give a simple recursive definition for the function $sos(A)$, which gives
the length of the shortest oscillating supersequence of an arbitrary array
A of integers.

\paragraph{Answer}

We create a new supersequence B, then we calculate the minimum and maximum values in A.
Then we go through each element in A and see if appending it keeps B oscillating. If it
doesn't, we append the proper min or max value first. We could just remember the last two
elements in B if we wanted to save space, too

It appears that the main algorithm is on the next page.

Give a simple recursive definition for the function $lxs(A)$, which gives
the length of the longest convex subsequence of an arbitrary array A of
integers

\paragraph{Answer}

For this one, we'll put $\infty$ then $-\infty$ on both sides of the array, then we'll check to see
if the next element is equal to t times the current one - the previous one. We'll just have to
remember the current element and the previous element.
